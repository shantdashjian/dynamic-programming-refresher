# Dynamic Programming Refresher

A number of coding interview problems solved using dynamic programming.

## DP Styles:
1. Memoization = Recursion + Dictionary
    - Draw a tree:
        1. The nodes are the inputs.
        2. The edges are the transtions, reductions, or shirnking of the problem.
        3. The leaves are the base case.
2. Tabulation = Iteration + List
    - Draw a table:
        1. The size of the table is the size of the inputs + 1.
        2. For an input of 3 and 3, have a 4 x 4 table/array. 

## Types of Questions:
1. Is there a way?
2. What's one way?
3. What the best way?
4. How many ways are there?
5. What are all the ways?

## Problems and Questions:
1. **Fibonacci Number:**
    1. What's the nth Fibonacci number?
2. **Travel in Grid:**
    1. How many ways to travel in a grid of m x n from start to end?
3. **Making the Sum out of Numbers | Making the Change out of Coins:**
    1. Can you make sum using the following number categories?
    2. What's one way to make the sum using these number categories?
    3. What's the shortest way to make the sum using these number categories?
4. **String Construction:**
    1. Can you construct this target string by concatenating elements from this array of strings?
    2. How many way can you construct this target string by concatenating elements from this array of strings?
    3. What are all the ways can you construct this target string by concatenating elements from this array of strings?
